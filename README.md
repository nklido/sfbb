## Sfbb (Superfast Broadband) availability tool

I created this tool to help me relocate to Athens and find an area that
supports a fiber connection. Growing up in a place with 2mbps speed, I just had to make sure ðŸ˜‚

By scraping Data from [sfbb](https://sfbb.gr/) and [Cosmote](https://www.cosmote.gr/hub/)
